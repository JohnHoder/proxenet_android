# Plugins

This section will detail examples and skeletons for writing `proxenet` plugins
in your favorite languages.


Each page will provide:

1. A raw skeleton that you can copy for your new plugins;
2. A plugin example: adding a new header in your requests.


Equipped with those information, you will not have any problem getting along and
starting making powerful plugins!

The [plugin page](../plugin) explains the general structure for writing
`proxenet`. Please refer to it for generic information on the plugin behavior,
or jump directly to your favorite language page.
