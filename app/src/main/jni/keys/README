This directory contains the key and certificate for proxenet CA. proxenet
handles its own on-the-fly SSL certificate generation using this CA root.

You can either generate a brand new tree(recommended) using the `make` command
or use your own private key and certificate.

If your private key is password protected, remember to specify this password on
the command when spawning `proxenet`.
